    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dish that brings me back to my days in 19th century London.</p>
    <p>It is quite the delicious delight on a warm summer night.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>900 g Skinned Eels</li>
        <li>Malt Vinegar</li>
        <li>4 whole Cloves</li>
        <li>3 Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>8 Black Peppercorns</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons Salt</li>
        <li>1 Lemon (zest and juice)</li>
        <li>1 small bunch of Curly Parsley</li>
        <li>Freshly ground White Pepper</li>
        <li>Brown Bread and Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, you need to prepare the eel. Using a sharp knife, cut the skin of the eel from the back of the head. Then, using fish pliers, pull away 2.5 cm of its skin.</li>
        <li>After skinning, lay the eel on the chopping board and cut off the head. Make a cut on the backbone, just above the lines of bones.</li>
        <li>Now, cut away the fillet. Keep the knife close to the bones.</li>
        <li>When the knife is close to the bones, hold the eel from another side and cut the fillet in a clean sweep. Repeat the same for the other side.</li>
        <li>Now cut the fillet into pieces of around 2.5cm in length diagonally.</li>
        <li>Then, take a large saucepan and add pieces with the ingredients, i.e., lemon juice, bay leaves, peppercorn, cloves, and salt.</li>
        <li>Pour cold water into the saucepan and bring this mixture to boil for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now, put the mixture in the bowl and cool it. After 10 minutes, stir it after adding parsley and chill it until the mixture is set.</li>
        <li>After the mixture is set and jelly is formed, it is ready to be served.</li>
    </ol>
