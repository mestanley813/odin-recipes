    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The mouthwatering look, the squishy texture, and the fragrant smell all make for a yummy dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces dried marrowfat peas</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>2 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream or milk (optional)</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons butter or to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <li> Place the peas in a large bowl or stockpot; they need plenty of room to expand. Add the baking soda and cover with 2 cups of boiling water. Stir until the baking soda dissolves.</li>
        <li> Let the peas soak for a minimum of 12 hours.</li>
        <li> Drain and rinse the peas well in a colander, then transfer them to a large pot.</li>
        <li> Cover the peas with cold water (about 2 cups) and bring them to a boil.</li>
        <li> Lower the heat and simmer the peas uncovered for approximately 30 minutes or until they soften and turn mushy.</li>
        <li> Season the peas with salt and pepper to taste. Add the optional sugar if you prefer them slightly sweeter, heavy cream or milk to give them a fluffier texture, or butter for flavor. You can also smash them with a fork for a smoother texture, or run them through the food processor if you prefer a puree.</li>
        <li> Serve the mushy peas hot with fish and chips or a tasty meat pie. Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
